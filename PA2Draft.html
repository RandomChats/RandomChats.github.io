  <h1>Nova McLaughlin</h1>

  <p>My name is Nova McLaughlin, and I'm a Software Developer and Unity Developer. 
    I am a second-year Boise State University student currently working toward my 
    Bachelor's Degree with the Games Interactive Media and Mobile major.

    Since I was young, I always had dreamed of working with Video Games in some 
    shape or form. As I grew older, I experimented with many facets of how to 
    contribute to making Video Games, and I found that I had a passion for working 
    with the programming and narrative sides of development. Since then, I have 
    begun to learn as much as I could about programming, both with Game Design, 
    as well as the uses languages have on their own. I specifically focused on 
    learning the Unity Engine, initially as a foundation, but that then turned 
    into wanting to master the engine, so I can apply my skills to other game 
    engines in the future.

  I have been using Unity for 4 years and am knowledgeable of the Unity Engine 
  as well as the specific use of C#, and the differences between C# itself 
  and C# within Unity. I have also been using Java for 3 years, developing 
  programs to help me gather a better understanding of Object-Oriented Programming 
  and common principles that are used within different OOP languages. In addition 
  to this, I also have 5 years of HTML, CSS, and Javascript experience, and 
  learned how to use libraries such as jQuery, Node.js, and React. I also used 
  PHP for back-end web development in conjunction with MySQL for database design and 
  management.
