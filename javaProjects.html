            This GitHub repository has 7 different Java projects that I worked
            on for my CS221 High School course. They each build upon one another
            through increasing complexity and challenges that I was required to
            program around. Most of these projects I have combined because they
            all culminated together in my Recursive List Sort project and Binary
            Trees project. Both projects are variations on the Double Linked
            List project but are done very differently from how the first
            project went. These projects required me to think outside the box
            and made me change how I thought about my process when it comes to
            programming. While working on these different data structures, I
            used the Eclipse IDE.

          <p class="sectionTitle">What I worked through</p>
          <p class="bodyText">
            After I had worked on DoubleLinkedLists, requiring me to have nodes
            that could be moved forward and backward, I was required to apply
            this same form of node movement with Recursion and a Binary Tree.
            This is where the biggest challenge came in for me. I had just come
            from working with linked lists, then I learned how recursion worked,
            and I remember struggling with the concept. After a very quick time
            learning Recursion, I was required to remake the project using
            Recursion, though I still didn't understand it. Throughout the
            project, I was learning how recursion worked while trying to get my
            code to work. After many hours researching examples of Recursion,
            and asking peers for some assistance, I was able to get the
            recursion working properly and was able to get the project done. The
            second project used a Binary Tree organization system, which also
            required us to make a sorter within the nodes so we could make a
            "proper" binary tree. My biggest struggle with this project was the
            requirement of allowing the user to go back to multiple nodes to add
            a new one. Since the nodes technically aren't actually "linked"
            altogether, instead being multiple separate instances of information
            linked together through 1 or 2 separate variables. In order to get
            the user to go through the tree, I used the original sort method I
            made for organizing the tree to be how I let a user move around the
            list.

          <p class="sectionTitle">What I Learned</p>
          <p class="bodyText">
            The single biggest skill I got from both of these projects was the
            ability to change and adapt. I was required to change my thought
            process while working on these different projects, despite being the
            same project. I realized that I needed to change my mindset when it
            came to working with projects because there will always be multiple
            ways to go about working on any given task. Code isn't an exception
            to that rule. Even going back and looking at these projects, they
            reminded me that I still have a lot to learn, and can always be
            improving. Reading my old READMEs even shows this, with one of the
            biggest points I made in each one being, "I was overcomplicating the
            work" or "I didn't realize this was an issue until it was." This is
            a mindset that while I still somewhat struggle with, I know it will
            always be a learning opportunity for me to improve my practice and
            understanding, and I shouldn't be scared of project complications
            that will arise.
