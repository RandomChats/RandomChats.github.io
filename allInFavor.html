            All In Favor was the main project that I worked on during my
            GIMMWorks Internship. My groupmates and I altogether were tasked
            with creating the framework, and a working demo for this website. We
            all used a combination of HTML/CSS, as well as Javascript/jQuery to
            produce the working framework. With this project, I was tasked with
            working on the Login/Signup webpages, and the home page designs.
            Aspects of websites that I was familiar with, but it still ended up
            being a fantastic learning experience nonetheless. During
            development, I used Visual Studio Code for my IDE, and commonly
            worked with Git.

          <p class="sectionTitle">What I worked through</p>
          <p class="bodyText">
            At the beginning of All In Favor, each of the interns was given
            pages to develop from the ground up, and I was tasked with creating
            the Homepage and Login pages. During the development process, we
            were given mockups created by the Project Manager and were required
            to take those mockups and turn them into pages for the website. As I
            worked on the pages, I came to realize that my current knowledge of
            HTML and CSS would not be enough to make the artistâ€™s vision come to
            fruition, so I needed to take the time to learn how to curate my
            skills to create the product. A good example of this was when I was
            asked to make a slide between the login and signup pages. The pages
            were to have an animation that slid across the screen as you
            switched between the login or signup pages while remaining on the
            same page. This required me to learn new ways to use CSS and
            incorporate Javascript into my stylization so that I could meet the
            artist's vision. The other part while developing these pages I kept
            in mind was the back-end development process requiring these pages
            to be easily accessible server side for user information, so I also
            created the pages with PHP integration at the time. During this
            process, I also took the time to learn Git, as it was the version
            control my team was using during the project. This came from a place
            where I was genuinely interested in how Git works, as I have only
            used Github, and wanted to understand how it worked on a more
            fundamental level. This knowledge came in handy toward the end of
            development when the team was having merging issues, and I was able
            to help diagnose the problem and make sure the project remained
            connected and stable.

          <p class="sectionTitle">What I Learned</p>
          <p class="bodyText">
            When going into this project, I already knew a lot of HTML/CSS, so
            even though I didn't learn large portions of that, I was still able
            to expand my knowledge of the languages and learn new tricks I would
            end up using and teaching others in the future. The biggest learning
            experience that I got from this project, however, was working with a
            team. Before this, most of my teamwork skills had been from school
            or my part-time job. This experience provided me with essential
            skills for working in groups in a work setting. Learning how to
            communicate with my other group members, as well as learning
            punctuality for deadlines throughout this project, were other
            pivotal skills that I took from this experience.
