            My name is Nova McLaughlin, and I'm a Software Developer and Unity
            Developer. I am a second-year Boise State University student
            currently working toward my Bachelor's Degree with the Games
            Interactive Media and Mobile major.

          <p class="bodyText">
            Since I was young, I always had dreamed of working with Video Games
            in some shape or form. As I grew older, I experimented with many
            facets of how to contribute to making Video Games, and I found that
            I had a passion for working with the programming and narrative sides
            of development. Since then, I have begun to learn as much as I could
            about programming, both with Game Design, as well as the uses
            languages have on their own. I specifically focused on learning the
            Unity Engine, initially as a foundation, but that then turned into
            wanting to master the engine, so I can apply my skills to other game
            engines in the future.
          </p>

          <p class="bodyText">
            I have been using Unity for 4 years and am knowledgeable of the
            Unity Engine as well as the specific use of C#, and the differences
            between C# itself and C# within Unity. I have also been using Java
            for 3 years, developing programs to help me gather a better
            understanding of Object-Oriented Programming and common principles
            that are used within different OOP languages. In addition to this, I
            also have 5 years of HTML, CSS, and Javascript experience, and
            learned how to use libraries such as jQuery, Node.js, and React. I
            also used PHP for back-end web development in conjunction with MySQL
            for database design and management.

        <p class="sectionSecondHead">StudioBLU Software Developer</p>
        <p class="sectionSubtext">May 2023 - March 2024</p>
        <p class="bodyText mb-2">
          While in my sophomore year of college, I worked with Studio/BLU in
          their New Product Development Lab team as a software developer,
          filling in the role for any programming they needed for projects. In
          my time here, I worked on a joint project for a client called
          ESiren/Golfball, which used GPS tracking and Bluetooth connection to
          someone's phone to give them information on a synced object's
          location. After my time with this project finished, I worked as a
          Content Course Designer creating training courses for people within
          the Food Manufacturing Industry.

        <p class="sectionSecondHead">GIMMWorks Development Team Intern</p>
        <p class="sectionSubtext">June 2021 - October 2021</p>
        <p class="bodyText">
          For this internship, my team and I were tasked with making the
          front-end framework for a project called All-In-Favor. Once the
          project reached a state where it could be reasonably transferred over
          to the main team for active development, I decided to use the
          remaining time I had to learn the basics of how Arduino's worked, as
          well as an introduction to 3D modeling to touch up on my skills. I
          also learned what it was like to work within a studio development
          setting, as well as working on a team.

        <p class="sectionSecondHead">Web Page Test updates</p>
        <p class="bodyText">
          Web Page Test had given me a few issues that I needed to solve, but
          for the most part said my site was okay. The site recommended I (1)
          add a "defer" to my bootstrap loads to help allow the page to render
          faster. The next change that was recommended was that I (2) add "link
          rel="preload" as="image" href"images/ selfImage.jpg">" to my website
          to help fetch the image on my homepage faster. Additionally, it also
          told me to (3) add lang="en" to each of my HTML elements, and to help
          the accessability of my (4) website by adding alt="" attributes to
          each of my images, which was the LinkedIn Logo and my image on the
          homepage.
