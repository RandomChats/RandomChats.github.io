          <p class="bodyText">
            This was a group project that I was a part of for my GIMM110 course.
            The goal of this project was to make a game that incorporated AR
            elements into a 2D game that we were to work on. We decided after
            talking amongst ourselves to make a 2D platformer game that would
            use AR Elements in mini-games, taking elements from games like Keep
            Talking and Nobody Explodes. I was one of the level designers and
            the AR developer for this project, using the experience I've had
            previously working with AR, I assumed initially that this project
            would be fairly straightforward, but that was far from the case.
            When working with the AR elements, and the in-game elements, I used
            Unity and their XR Toolkit.

          <p class="sectionTitle">What I worked through</p>
          <p class="bodyText">
            Being upfront with this project, at least in my eyes, it was overall
            a failure. I remember many times in the early stages of our project,
            we had to change our ideas time and time again because we kept
            finding that it was either too ambitious for our group, we wouldn't
            have enough time, or our professor pointed out crucial flaws about
            the gameplay loop. After eventually landing on the game idea we all
            had, it already felt like we were slightly behind on our group work.
            This didn't stop all of us, however, and we began working on the
            game when we all came to a consensus. The first aspect of the game
            we worked through was the basic 2D game itself, this didn't take
            much time, and we were able to very quickly get the level and
            side-level fields made up. The issue comes from the AR itself. Our
            idea was that there would be a map that would be displayed on an
            outward-facing camera, and a second player would be assisted through
            the maze from the first player. A very large wall that I encountered
            time and time again was the collision between the player moving
            through the maze. I could get the map to display on the screen, and
            I could get the player icon to show up on the screen, but no matter
            what I tried, I was unable to figure out how to get the collisions
            to work. I spent hours researching the problem and got assistance
            from multiple people who had worked with AR in the past, but nothing
            seemed to work out perfectly. As the deadline for the project
            neared, I realized what the issue was, and learned that the issue
            was irreversible. When I was generating the second player's game
            object to move through the maze, what I failed to realize was that
            the maze I had embedded on the screen would also move with the game
            object, but would still display properly. This meant it also moved
            the colliders for the maze, making it near impossible to get the
            objects separated. I tried to figure out a solution to this, but as
            the deadline came, I was unable to get a fix working for the game.

          <p class="sectionTitle">What I Learned</p>
          <p class="bodyText">
            Overall, this project was very stressful for me, but in this stress,
            I was able to learn that even if I'm facing a challenge, having the
            determination to push forward and work through the issues facing me
            is extremely beneficial to me. While I feel I was unable to meet the
            objectives I set out for myself, I also learned to properly lower my
            scope and to properly pivot when needed. If I decided earlier on to
            switch to a different concept for our AR usage, it would have been
            great for us to make that adjustment. This project also taught me
            that if something isn't working for me, I need to change my ideas or
            get other opinions to see if my work would be too far-fetched.
