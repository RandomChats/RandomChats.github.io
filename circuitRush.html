          <p class="bodyText">
            Circuit Rush was one of my first deep dives into a working game
            concept that I had been wanting to work on for a long time. The
            basic idea I originally had was "What if there was a tower defense
            game that required you to let enemies through?" From this idea, I
            took inspiration from games like Defense Grid: The Awakening, and
            Bloons Tower Defense to make a prototype for my game. From those
            games, I wanted to add the element of requiring players to let
            enemies through to complete the waves. One issue that first came up
            early in the brainstorming process for me was how to handle the
            early game, since in tower defense games, basic towers can handle
            the waves fairly easily. I decided to then add a disable feature to
            towers, making it so they couldn't shoot, but not selling them
            outright. This game was created in the Unity Engine.

          <p class="sectionTitle">What I worked through</p>
          <p class="bodyText">
            I very clearly remember two main areas where I struggled while
            working on this project. The first was the tower management system,
            and the second was the disabling feature. With the tower management
            system, I had to be calling and distinguishing between multiple
            instances of Game Objects within my game to get it to properly work.
            Because I was using a HUD that would pop up on empty squares where
            towers could be placed, I needed to make sure that when the square
            was clicked, it would bring up the correct menu, but I also needed
            to store the clicked tile. This meant I couldn't just assign the
            tiles to the hud, I needed to make sure I was tracking which tile I
            was interacting with. After making sure that the tile information
            was stored properly, it was easy for me to create the basic template
            for towers, and to add more tower variations. The next struggle was
            the disabling feature. With the disabling mechanic, when clicking on
            my tower, I needed to call the same hud, but with different elements
            attached to it for the tower, so I first needed to make sure I
            wouldn't pull the wrong tile, opening up the wrong menu, or I needed
            to make sure that the tower the user was interacting with was the
            proper one. After getting the proper tower to be selected for my
            menu, the next problem that came up was my colliders overlapping
            with one another on my Game Objects, preventing them from both
            shooting any enemies on the track and being interacted with. After
            taking a look through my Game Object's colliders, I decided the best
            course of action would be to layer the colliders on different
            layers, preventing them from meshing with one another. This solved
            both towers not shooting enemies, and still let players interact
            with the tower freely.

          <p class="sectionTitle">What I Learned</p>
          <p class="bodyText">
            The most important aspect that I learned from working on this
            project was versatility and needing to research certain aspects of
            games beforehand. Most of this project was hard-coded from scratch,
            using very minimal help from others, or Google searches outside of
            certain function names within Unity. This project was very
            time-consuming for me while I was working on it, but it was a very
            great learning experience for me. I realized one of the biggest
            benefits I gained was knowing how to pivot to other aspects of the
            project if I ever got stuck. Many times I would get stuck working on
            a solution of some kind, so I started to pivot to other aspects of
            the project, allowing me to process my issue or bug in the
            background, only to come back to it knowing the solution, and how to
            program it.
